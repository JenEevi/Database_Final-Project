# Database_Final-Project

This was my final school assignment in my database class. Here, I built a database on the school hosted server using phpMyAdmin and MySQL.
The files that are included here were for the user interface to query and display the data using html and php. Although not required, I added CSS to enhance the way the data was displayed.
